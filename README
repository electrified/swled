--------------------------- SWITCHES & LEDS EXAMPLES ---------------------------

CKSUM:
    Keep a running 16-bit checksum of bytes written to channel 0 in registers
    connected to channels 1 & 2. The checksum is also displayed on the 7-segment
    display, and the last byte written is shown on the eight LEDs. Reading from
    channel 0 yields the state of the eight switches.

FIFO:
    Channel 0 is connected to two FIFOs:
    (a) A "producer" FIFO whose other end connects to an upcounter whose speed
        is controlled by switches 0-3.
    (b) A "consumer" FIFO whose other end connects to the eight LEDs, and whose
        speed is controlled by switches 4-7.

Both examples use the same board-level I/O: eight switches, eight LEDs and a
4-digit 7-segment display.
